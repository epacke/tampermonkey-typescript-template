# Tampermonkey typescript template
I've written Tampermonkey scripts for years but after starting to use Typescript
instead of Javascript it was a pain to develop new ones.

Thus I did what I usually do when I'm looking for a solution: Google, copy, modify

Here's the result. Feel free to Copy and modify. :)
